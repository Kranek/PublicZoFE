# awareness.100 - Uncloaked fleet enters system, chance to gain 1 awareness.
#				- Also fires if a fleet decloaks in a pre-ftl system.
# awareness.105 - Space battle concluded, chance to gain 5 awareness.
# awareness.110 - Yearly pulse event - uncloaked observation post in orbit, chance to gain 2 awareness.
# awareness.115 - Uncloaked science ship surveys pre-ftl planet, chance to gain 2 awareness.
#				- Also fired by building an observation post in orbit of a pre-ftl planet.
# awareness.120 - Outpost, mining or research station built, chance to gain 1 awareness.
# awareness.125 - Pre-ftl planet bombarded or invaded, sets awareness to 100.
# awareness.130 - Fleet engages emergency FTL, chance to gain 2 awareness.
# awareness.135 - Planet colonised in pre-ftl system, chance to gain 5 awareness.
# awareness.140 - Colony in pre-ftl system, chance to gain 2 awareness.
# awareness.145 - Megastructure built or upgraded in pre-ftl system, chance to gain 5 awareness.
# awareness.150 - Planet cracker used, chance to gain 20 awareness.
# awareness.155 - Neighbouring system destroyed, chance to gain 20 awareness.
# awareness.160 - Increased awareness to next threshold, fire a notification for any observer.
# awareness.165 - Decreased awareness to previous threshold, fire a notification for any observer.
# awareness.170 - Clears the current observation mission ensuring that the "No Mission" is selected.
# awareness.200 - Passive awareness decay. Chance to reduce awareness by 1
